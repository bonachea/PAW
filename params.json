PGAS models also take the form of meta-languages \r\nand libraries, such as Unified Parallel C++ (UPC++), Co-Array C++, \r\nOpenSHMEM, MPI-3 and Global Arrays.\r\nThese have the benefit of being integrated with existing languages, \r\nsimplifying the learning curve for existing programmers.\r\n\r\nThe increasing availability of PGAS compilers and support software\r\nopens up more opportunities than ever for researchers and developers\r\nto test new strategies and port applications to more demanding\r\nrequirements. \r\n\r\n### Scope and Aims\r\nThe scope of the PAW workshop is to provide a forum for exhibiting case studies of PGAS\r\nprogramming models in the context of real-world applications as a means of better\r\nunderstanding practical applications of PGAS technologies.  We encourage the submission\r\nof papers and talks detailing practical PGAS applications, including characterizations of\r\nscalability and performance, of expressiveness and programmability, as well as any downsides\r\nor areas for improvement in existing PGAS models. In addition to informing other application\r\nprogrammers about the potential that is available through PGAS programming, the workshop is\r\ndesigned to communicate these experiences to compiler vendors, library developers, and system\r\narchitects in order to achieve broader support for PGAS programming across the community.\r\n\r\n### Topics\r\nTopics include, but are not limited to:\r\n* Novel application development using the PGAS model\r\n* Real-world examples demonstrating performance, compiler\r\n  optimization, error checking, and reduced software complexity.\r\n* Performance evaluation of applications running under PGAS\r\n* Algorithmic models enabled by PGAS model\r\n* Compiler and runtime environments\r\n* Libraries using/supporting PGAS and applications\r\n* Benefits of hardware abstraction and data\r\n  locality on algorithm implementation.\r\n\r\n### Organization\r\n## Workshop Chair\r\nKarla Morris - Sandia National Laboratory\r\n\r\n## Organizing Committee\r\n* Katherine A.
