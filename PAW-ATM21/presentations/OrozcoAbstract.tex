\begin{abstract}
    New generation Tier-0 computers will cross soon the mythic Exa-Scale barrier. 
    It is however less clear that such massive computers will be used in a fruitful
    manner in complex systems such as the biological one, where individual problems
    rarely fits the ideal requirements for massively parallel computers. 
    I will summarize in my talk recent advances done in Barcelona within the context
    of the BioExcel Center of Excellence to facilitate an optimal use of future 
    Exa-Scale computers in the field of computational biology.
